# Method 2:


Overview of the Optimization Approach
The Python tool implements a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach combined with combinatorial optimization to select the best portfolio of energy retrofit projects under a fixed budget constraint. Let me break down the methodology:

# 1. Combinatorial Optimization with Exhaustive Search
```# Generate all possible combinations of projects
for r in range(1, len(project_names) + 1):
    for combo in combinations(project_names, r):
        total_cost = sum(self.projects[p]['cost'] for p in combo)
        
        # Skip if over budget
        if total_cost > self.budget:
            continue
        
        # Calculate combined score for this combination
        total_score = 0
        for p in combo:
            score = self.calculate_combined_score(
                self.projects[p], financial_weight, carbon_weight
            )
            total_score += score'''
